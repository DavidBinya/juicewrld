            <p class="text">Jarad Anthony Higgins (December 2, 1998 – December 8, 2019), known professionally as Juice
                Wrld (pronounced "juice world"; stylized as Juice WRLD), was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter
                from Chicago, Illinois. His song "Lucid Dreams" has been played on the music streaming platform Spotify
                over one billion times. "Lucid Dreams" along with his earlier hit single "All Girls Are the Same" helped
                him gain a recording contract with Lil Bibby's Grade A Productions and Interscope Records.
                <br> <br>
                "All Girls Are the Same" and "Lucid Dreams" were two of five singles that were included in Higgins'
                debut studio album Goodbye & Good Riddance (2018), which went on to become certified Platinum by the
                Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album enjoyed positive critical reception, and
                contained three other singles: "Lean wit Me", "Wasted", and "Armed and Dangerous", all of which charted
                on the Billboard Hot 100. After collaborating with Future on the mixtape Wrld on Drugs (2018), Higgins
                released his second studio album Death Race for Love (2019), which reached number one on the Billboard
                200. It contained the singles "Robbery" and "Hear Me Calling".
                <br> <br>
                Higgins died eight months later following a drug-related seizure at Midway International Airport. His
                death prompted an outpouring of grief across social media and the music industry. His first posthumous
                album, Legends Never Die (2020), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The album was the most
                successful posthumous chart debut in over 20 years and matched a record for the most top-ten song
                entries on the Hot 100 at one time. The album's fourth single, "Come & Go" with Marshmello, became
                Higgins' second song to reach number two on that chart after "Lucid Dreams".
